--13 It is thought that since left-handed pitchers are more rare, causing batters to face them less often, that they are more effective. Investigate this claim and present evidence to either support or dispute this claim. 
	
--While it is true that left handed pitchers are more rare overll than right handed pitchers, it cannont be said that one is more effective over the other based upon the percentage of each who won the Cy Young Award and the perecentage of each inducted into the Hall of Fame. However, if effectiveness is based only upon the percentage of each winning the Cy Young award, then yes, left handed pitchers would be more effective.
